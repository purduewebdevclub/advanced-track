# Week 1

## This week is when we start out easy:

* Node
    Node is an environment that allows you to create awesome things with little amount
    of work. For example, you can have a server up and running in about 15 lines of 
    JavaScript. 
    
    Node also comes with NPM. NPM is a package manager that contains modules. Each module
    is used to make your life much easier. For example, if you want to show custom notifications
    you can go ahead and download and import the custom notifications module. 

* Webpack
    
    Webpack is a build system. Build systems prepare your source code for serving.
    Normally your raw code can't be served right away so you send your source to a 
    build system and it translates everything for you.
