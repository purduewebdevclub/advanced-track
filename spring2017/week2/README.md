# Week 2

## This week gets into the more advanced topics:

* TypeScript

    TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. It takes ES2015 features and adds types 
    to them. What are types? Well, in JS you have variables everywhere, but these variables
    are dynamically typed, as in what kind of variable they are is determined during run-time.

* Intro to Angular 2

    Angular 2 is the main subject matter of this semester. We introduce Components.
    Components are custom html elements. They allow you to separate your site into 
    different concerns. For example, I can have a component for each page. Components
    aren't only custom html elements, they allow you to add custom html to wherever 
    they are added. For example, if you have a menu that you'd like to show in multiple 
    places, you can use a custom component for that menu. This saves a lot of time and 
    effort that goes into code duplication.
